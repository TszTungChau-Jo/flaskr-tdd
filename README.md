# flaskr-tdd
This repo is created for exercise for ECE444 PRA3

# Accessing the Web Page
The project is deployed on the Render server, access the page by: https://flaskr-tdd-6nv5.onrender.com
(The render database is only free for 30 days, so I belive after Oct 2025, the database will be lost and the project would not work by then.)

## Accessing Render Dashboard
Login and manage projects on render by: https://dashboard.render.com/
